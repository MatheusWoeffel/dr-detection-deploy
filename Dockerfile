# Install the package as normal:
COPY environment.yml .
RUN conda env create -f environment.yml

# Install conda-pack:
RUN conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack

# Use conda-pack to create a standalone enviornment
# in /venv:
RUN conda-pack -n env -o /tmp/env.tar && \
  mkdir /venv && cd /venv && tar xf /tmp/env.tar && \
  rm /tmp/env.tar

# We've put venv in same path it'll be in final image,
# so now fix up paths:
RUN /venv/bin/conda-unpack

# The runtime-stage image; we can use Debian as the
# base image since the Conda env also includes Python
# for us.

# keeps Python from writing the .pyc files which are unnecessary in this case. We also update
# PATH so that the train and serve programs are found when the container is invoked.
